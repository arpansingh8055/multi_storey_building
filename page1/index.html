                <p>Indore is becoming a center of employment, we have planned and designed the construction of the main
                    building of a residential society of approved standards to fulfill the needs of the current
                    situation.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In our project, we have aimed to satisfy the basic requirements of a complete basic family
                    requirements. Allocating the available space for different functions the entire structure was
                    developed. The structure was then analyzed and designed in AutoCAD and REVIT.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The materials adopted for this project are M20 and FE415 HYSD bars.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Suitable reinforcements and a stress applies in the works are acquired by making reference to the
                    codel provisions. Hence the structure is designed to perform the functions of safety serviceability.
                    Carrying out a complete analysis and design of the main structural elements of a hostel including
                    slabs, beams, columns and foundations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The building is designed as per the national building code in which the structure will be economical
                    for the construction. The building provides all the requirements needed for the safety and the
                    staircase is designed for the emergency exit also.

                <div class="heading">Site plane</div>
                <p>The site plan is a detailed diagram that displays the whole layout of a building. It indicates the
                    site’s
                    borders including access points, as well as nearby structures that are important for the design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These plans must follow local development laws, which may include limitations on historical sites.
                    It
                    works as an official agreement for obtaining government approval for construction.
                    A certified specialist, such as an architect, landscape architect, and engineer, must develop the
                    site
                    plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the case of a construction project, the site plan must include indicating all essential
                    connections,
                    such as drainage as well as sewer lines, electrical and communications cables, water supply,
                    external
                    lighting, and so on.

                    <br>
                    For a multi-storey building, the site plan will typically include:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Building footprint: The outline of the building itself, showing its size and shape in relation to
                    the surrounding land.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Access points: Entrances, exits, driveways, and pedestrian walkways, indicating how people and
                    vehicles will enter and exit the site.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Parking and circulation: Designated areas for parking, loading zones, and traffic flow patterns for
                    vehicles within the site.

                <div class="heading">Center Line</div>
                <p>Center Line is a line that passes through the center of a column. Grid of similar lines for a number
                    of
                    columns form a centre line plan. Centre line plans helps you understand the exact positioning of a
                    column on site.Column may be of different dimensions and but may have same center line. Centre line
                    grid
                    for columns are plotted on a land before beginning excavations. Checking for center line of a column
                    grid ensures that columns are located at exact locations as per drawings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The goal of centerline layout is to create a design that feels cohesive, organized, and visually
                    appealing. While not every design necessarily follows a centerline layout, its application is often
                    driven by the desired aesthetic and functional considerations of a particular project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Structural alignment: The centerline aids in aligning structural elements such as columns, beams,
                    walls, and cores throughout the building. It ensures uniformity and helps maintain structural
                    stability.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Vertical circulation: In multi-storey buildings, staircases, elevators, and service cores are often
                    positioned along a central or designated centerline for efficient vertical circulation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Partition layout: It assists in the layout and positioning of interior walls, partitions, and rooms
                    on different floors, maintaining consistency and symmetry.

                <div class="heading">Footing</div>
                <p>The term "footing layout" typically refers to the plan or design that specifies the location, size,
                    and
                    configuration of footings for a building or structure. Footings are the structural elements that
                    transfer the load from the building to the soil, and the footing layout is crucial for ensuring the
                    stability and integrity of the overall construction. It includes details such as the dimensions of
                    the
                    footings, their depth below the ground, and their spacing and alignment according to the building's
                    design and the soil conditions
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The layout of the footings and what to do with the footing excavation excess soil material should be
                    considered together. Some construction supervisor’s use batter boards at each corner to give the
                    line
                    and the grade of the building. Others use offset hubs to determine line and an elevation benchmark
                    for
                    grade. With either method, you need to consider how much offset is required from the actual wall
                    lines
                    in order to accomplish the excavation. These items should be thought through in advance of the
                    actual
                    layout and footing excavation in order to proceed in the most effective manner. Foundations vary
                    according to their use, the soil-bearing capacity, and the type of material available. The material
                    may
                    be cut stone, rock, brick, concrete, tile, or wood, depending on the weight the foundation is to
                    support.

                <div class="heading">Plinth Beam</div>
                <p>A plinth beam is a reinforced concrete beam constructed at or above ground level, typically at the
                    junction of the wall and the foundation. The plinth beam helps distribute the load of the wall
                    evenly to
                    the foundation, provides lateral stability to the structure, and acts as a tie beam to resist
                    torsional
                    forces.
                    <br>
                    <br>The layout of a plinth beam involves the arrangement of its dimensions, reinforcement, and
                    construction details
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Load distribution: Plinth beams help distribute the load of the building evenly to the foundation by
                    transferring the load from the walls and columns to the foundation system. They help in preventing
                    differential settlement of the structure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Stability and strength: By providing additional stability to the building, plinth beams contribute
                    to the overall strength of the structure against horizontal forces like wind and seismic loads.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Preventing soil moisture: Plinth beams are often constructed slightly above ground level to prevent
                    the transfer of moisture from the ground to the building structure, thereby reducing the risk of
                    dampness and potential damage due to moisture.

                    any project is the concept and design. The next step is to create
                    construction drawings when everything is in place. When a floor plan is
                    finished, it is given to the mechanical engineer, who will generate

                    plumbing drawings.<br>
                    <br> The illustrations are added to the constructiondrawing set. A set of construction drawings'
                    mechanical division will
                    include, in addition to plumbing plans and details, drawings for any
                    heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems that a building may
                    have

                <p>The site plan is a detailed diagram that displays the whole layout of a
                    building. It indicates the site’s borders including access points, as well

                    These plans must follow local development laws, which may include

                <div class="heading">Ground Floor Layout</div>
                <p>Designing the layout for the ground floor of a building involves
                    planning the arrangement and distribution of spaces, rooms, and
                    functional areas. The specific layout will depend on factors such
                    as the purpose of the building, the number of occupants, and
                    architectural considerations
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Entrances and Exits: The ground floor layout usually includes main entrances for pedestrians and
                    vehicles, emergency exits, and lobby areas. These areas are designed for ease of access and often
                    serve as the primary point of entry to the building.
                    <br><br>
                    Common Areas: This level might contain common spaces such as reception areas, waiting rooms, or
                    gathering spaces intended for general use by occupants or visitors.
                    <br><br>
                    Service Areas: Ground floors commonly house service areas like maintenance rooms, storage spaces,
                    utility rooms, or garbage disposal areas. These spaces support the building's functionality but are
                    often placed discreetly or separated from public areas.

                <div class="heading">Slab Beam</div>
                <p>The slab-beam layout refers to the arrangement and design of the structural elements that form the
                    floors and provide support to the structure. This layout involves the placement of slabs, beams, and
                    columns to create a sturdy framework for each floor. Here's a breakdown of these components:
                    <br><br>
                    Slabs: Slabs are horizontal structural elements that form the floors of the building. They provide a
                    platform for people, furniture, and equipment. Slabs can be of various types such as flat slabs,
                    ribbed slabs, waffle slabs, or post-tensioned slabs, depending on the structural requirements and
                    design preferences.
                    <br><br>
                    Beams: Beams are horizontal or inclined structural members that provide support to the slabs and
                    transfer the load from the slabs to the columns or walls. They reinforce the structure by
                    distributing the load and resisting bending forces.
                    <br><br>
                    Columns: Columns are vertical load-bearing members that support the beams and transfer the load
                    further down to the foundation. They play a crucial role in the building's stability and are
                    strategically placed according to the building's design and structural requirements.

                    It consists
                    of electrical symbols and lines that showcase the engineer's electrical
                    design to its clients. In short, an electrical plan describes the position of
                    all the electrical apparatus.

                    <br>
                    The purpose of an elevation drawing is to show
                    the finished appearance of a given side of the house and furnish vertical
                    height dimensions. Four elevations are customarily drawn, one for each
                    side of the house.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <p>Floor Plan means a Division-approved diagram of a building’s
                    interior, as seen from above, that shows the interior dimensions

                    The first floor's design balances functional needs, safety requirements, and aesthetic
                    considerations. Architects and designers carefully plan this level to ensure it meets building
                    codes, accessibility standards, and the specific needs of the occupants or users. The layout serves
                    as a starting point for the rest of the building, establishing the groundwork for subsequent floors
                    while providing essential amenities and spaces for the building's users.
